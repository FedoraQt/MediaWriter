/*
 * How this (Downloader stuff) works:
 * not very well
 *
 * All of this should be rewritten at some point (and I admit it's possible it never will be - for
 *  reference, today is Nov 9 2016)
 *
 * There are three classes:
 * Download, DownloadManager and DownloadReceiver
 *
 * DownloadReceiver is just an abstract class you should inherit in a class that you want to receive
 *  notifications about finished downloads.
 * I should have probably done that using a signal. Nothing wrong with this so far though.
 *
 * DownloadManager is the entry point where you request a download and provide your
 *  DownloadReceiver implementation that will be notified about it having finished at some point in the future.
 * You're able to either request a string containing whatever it found at the URL
 *  or you can get a path to a file where all the data from the link will be stored.
 * Getting strings is pretty straightforward while downloading files is not easy at all.
 *
 * When downloading a file, the Manager asks the Fedora mirror service for a list of mirrors first.
 * At the same time, it creates a Download object (there can be only one at a time) and waits.
 * After getting the mirrosr, it inserts a new QNetworkReply inside the Download which starts
 *  crunching the incoming data. That means it stores it to a .part file while also computing a SHA256 hash.
 * If the mirror stops supplying data or the network breaks, it tries accessing another repo from the list.
 * If there is no list provided by the server, it tries to just download from the metadata URL directly.
 *
 * This all would work well if we didn't have to support download resuming.
 * If you have to resume a download, the newly-created Download object starts to compute the SHA256 hash
 *  while the Manager waits for the mirror list.
 * When the mirror list is delivered, a new QNetworkReply is created and inserted into the Download if
 *  (and only if) it's done computing the hash of the part already on the drive (hasCatchedUp() method).
 * Otherwise, it lets the Download finish with its business of computing the hash. It will ask for a new mirror
 *  when it's done. From this point, everything continues exactly as if it wasn't continuing.
 * For this reason I think there's a slight (really very small) possibility of getting stuck, forcing the user
 *  to reset the process.
